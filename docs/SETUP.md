# Developer Setup Guide - project-develop-a-financial

This guide provides a comprehensive setup for developers working on `project-develop-a-financial`, a financial services platform.  We recommend using Docker for development, but native setup instructions are also provided.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software Versions

* **Docker:** 20.10.0 or later (for Docker option)
* **Docker Compose:** 1.29.0 or later (for Docker option)
* **Node.js:** 16.x or later (for both options)
* **Python:** 3.9 or later (for both options)
* **PostgreSQL:** 14 or later (or compatible database specified in project requirements)


### Development Tools

* Git
* Text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
*  Postman or similar API testing tool


### IDE Recommendations and Configurations

* **VS Code:** Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and potentially PostgreSQL support.  Configure linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) as described in the Development Workflow section.
* **IntelliJ IDEA:** Configure Python and JavaScript plugins.  Set up linters similarly to VS Code.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-develop-a-financial
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:**  This file (located in the project root) will define the services (database, backend, frontend). A sample structure:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - .env
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The specific setup depends on your frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).  Most frameworks offer hot reloading capabilities through their development servers.  For example, with React and `create-react-app`:  `npm start` will enable hot reloading.


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Download and install PostgreSQL. Create a database with the name and credentials specified in your `.env` file.  Example using `psql`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
   CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db_name TO your_db_user;
   ```


## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

The `.env` file (example below) will hold sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.  **Never commit this file to version control.** Add it to your `.gitignore`.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key #Example
# ... other environment variables ...
```

### Local Development `.env` File Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables for your local development environment.

### Configuration for Different Environments

Use environment variables to manage configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).  A robust solution might involve a dedicated configuration management system.


## Running the Application

### Start Commands for Development

* **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
* **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` if using Django) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

### How to Access Frontend and Backend

* **Frontend:** Access the frontend application through your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or development server).
* **Backend:** Access the backend API through tools like Postman or by making requests directly from the frontend.  The API base URL will likely be `http://localhost:8000` (adjust based on your setup).

### API Documentation Access

The project should ideally include API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).  Refer to the project's documentation for access instructions.


## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

Use a Git branching strategy like Gitflow (feature branches, develop branch, main branch).

### Code Formatting and Linting Setup

* **Backend (Python):** Use `black` for formatting and `flake8` or `pylint` for linting.  Configure your IDE to automatically format and lint code on save.
* **Frontend (JavaScript):** Use `prettier` for formatting and `ESLint` for linting.  Similar IDE configuration as the backend.

### Testing Procedures

Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.  Utilize testing frameworks like `pytest` (Python) and `Jest` (JavaScript).

### Debugging Setup

Use your IDE's debugging tools.  For backend debugging, you can use Python's `pdb` (Python Debugger).


## Database Management

### Running Migrations

The specific commands depend on your ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).  For Django: `python manage.py migrate`.

### Seeding Development Data

Create scripts to seed your database with sample data for development purposes.

### Database Reset Procedures

Create scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
#Example for pytest
pytest
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
#Example command - adjust as needed
pytest -m integration
```

### Test Coverage Reports

Use tools like `coverage` (Python) to generate test coverage reports.


## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New API Endpoints

Follow the project's API design guidelines.  Write unit and integration tests for the new endpoint.

### Adding New Frontend Components

Follow the project's frontend component architecture.  Ensure proper styling and functionality.

### Database Schema Changes

Make schema changes through migrations.  Thoroughly test the changes.

### Adding Dependencies

Use `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript) to add dependencies.  Update the relevant files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).


## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

* Check that all prerequisites are installed correctly.
* Verify that ports are not already in use.
* Ensure that environment variables are correctly set.

### Port Conflicts Resolution

Check which process is using the conflicting port and either stop the process or change the port in your configuration.

### Dependency Issues

Carefully examine error messages, and use tools like `pipdeptree` (Python) or `npm ls` (JavaScript) to analyze your dependencies.

### Environment Variable Problems

Double-check the spelling and values of your environment variables.  Use a debugger to inspect the values at runtime.


## Contributing

### Code Style Guidelines

Follow the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

### Pull Request Process

Create feature branches, write clear commit messages, and create pull requests with comprehensive descriptions and testing.

### Issue Reporting

Report bugs and feature requests using the project's issue tracker.  Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue.


This guide provides a starting point.  Refer to the project's specific documentation for more details and customizations. Remember to replace placeholder values (like `<repository_url>`, `your_db_user`, etc.) with your actual values.
