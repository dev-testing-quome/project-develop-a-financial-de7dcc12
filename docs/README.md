   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   * **Backend (from `backend` directory):**
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend (from `frontend` directory):**

     npm run dev
     ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run:
